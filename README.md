## iPhone Compatibility
Please note that PDANet does not support iPhone devices for tethering. This is due to the closed nature of iOS and its restrictions on USB tethering and third-party applications. As a result, PDANet is only compatible with Android devices.

## Connection Issues with Video Games and Sites
While using your PC as a hotspot via tethering, you may encounter issues where certain video games or websites report that you are offline, even though your internet connection is functioning properly. This can happen for several reasons, including:

1. **Network Restrictions**: Some games and services may impose restrictions on peer-to-peer (P2P) connections, which can prevent proper communication between your device and their servers.

2. **IP Address Configuration**: Tethering may assign a different IP address to your connection, which can lead to confusion in how certain applications perceive your online status.

3. **Firewall or NAT Issues**: The configuration of your network, particularly regarding firewalls or Network Address Translation (NAT), can also cause connectivity problems.

To resolve these issues, using a VPN can be very helpful. A VPN (Virtual Private Network) can:

- **Improve Connection Stability**: By masking your IP address and routing your traffic through a secure server, a VPN can bypass network restrictions and stabilize your connection.
- **Enhance Privacy and Security**: VPNs encrypt your internet traffic, making it more secure and private.

For reliable performance, I recommend using [Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com/), known for its user-friendly interface and strong privacy policies. It supports P2P connections, making it an excellent choice for gamers and users of streaming services.
